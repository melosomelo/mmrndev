This is my personal website, built with Typescript, NextJS and Sass! In it, I
show case my current skills and my experience as a web developer.

## About the project ðŸ“˜

I think that every developer should have his/her portfolio. It's a good
entrypoint for anyone who wants know you and your work. So, I pretty much had to
do it.

This was my first project using **Sass** and I definitely see why some people'd
use it. But, I feel like this was kinda overkill for what I wanted to do here. I
still prefer styled-components for React.
